# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

**NeuralLink Corp**

* When was the company incorporated?: 
    - The company was incorperated in July, 2016. 

* Who are the founders of the company?: 
    - Neuralink Corp was founded by Elon Musk and many more experts. Ben Rapoport (a Neurosurgeon), Dongjin Seo (an electrical engineer), Paul Merolla (a Neuroengnieer), Philip Sabes (a Neuroscientist), Tim Hanson (a Biomedical Engineer), and Tim Gardner(a Neuroscientist), just to name a few. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?:
    - The idea came from Elon Musk. He had a longing interest for technology that could be used to enhance the functions of a human. He wants to use the Neuralink to merge humans and their brain with AI.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    - Originally, Elon Musk invested large sums of his own money into the kickstart of the company. This funding was used to gather a capable team for early research and development. They later did private funding rounds in that they would conduct certain events to attract potental investors. As of 2023 Neuralink has raised on $363 million in total funding. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - There are many specific problems that Neuralink Corp is trying to solve. They believe that the Neuralink will be able to treat neurological disorders, enhance human capabilites such as memory, learning, and sensory functions. They also are trying to get users to achieve symbiosis with AI. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    - The intended customers are pretty broad an almost anyone. Either people with medical issues, or just the general consumer such and normal tech enthusiasts. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    - They offer an advanced technology called the BMI. It has high-bandwidth Neural Interfaces, wireless communication, scalable and updatable systems, and many more things that make it superior to its competitors. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    - They use flexible electrode arrays (very thin electrodes that are put into one's brain with very minimal damage), custom chips (customized chips for a user that process signals and transmit data), and many more. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
    - Neurotechnology, brain-machine interfaces, neuroscience, AI.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
    - Improved neural interfaces, machine learning in neuroscience, non invasive BMIs, and Neuroprosthetics.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
    - Kernal, Synchron, Paradromics, and Blackrock Neurotech

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    - Neuralink has been one of the biggest companies when it comes to gaining significant interest in the idea of brain chips from both the general public and private investors.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
    - Research Progress, Regulatory Approvals, Technological Advancements, and Partnerships and collaberations/investor relations.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
    - Neuralink is preforming a lot better than the other companies as it has more advanced BMI systems and much more funding compared to other companies, but other competitors like Synchron have made more progress with human trials.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - Put more research into non invasive BMIs.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - I feel that this is the main problem that people are afraid of when it comes to this type of technology. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - This would allow for more people want to use a Neuralink, which would cause greater advancements in this type of technology due to the greater use.
